System-tray monitor for the Juggernaut
======================================

the gem creates a icon in your system-tray showing a smily that will change it's mood depending on the status of configured builds:

- happy: all builds are ok
- angry: some builds have errors
- sad:   some builds are unreachable (eg: server down) or no build is configured

the smily will popup messages when build-status has changed and provides a context-menu to add / edit / remove your builds.

once some builds are configured the gem will poll their status in a 3 minutes intervall.

you can also double click the smily to imediatelly trigger a status update, 
or open a build's corresponding Juggernaut-website by clicking the build in the context-menu.

Setup
=====

a build is defined by a identifier of format <build-name>@<server-url> where:

- "server-url" is the valid url of the main Juggernaut website, eg: <server-name>:<server-port> or http://<server-ip>:<server-port>
- "build-name" is the case-sensitive (!) name of a build as shown on the Juggernaut website

to add a build "right-click" the tray-icon and go "Setup" / "Add"

all configured builds are stored in a "Juggertray.dat" file in the gem's working-directory, 
where you can also configure your builds by adding a build each line and restart the gem to apply changes, afterwards.
